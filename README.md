# Gritt Ninja

>This is a web based game that is designed to test your reflexes and cutting skills.

I wanted to try [KaboomJS](https://kaboomjs.com/) and thought it would be fun to remake the popular [Fruit Ninja](https://fruitninja.com/) game in Javascript.

## Motivation

Since the core mechanics of the game are simple, I thought it would be a good project to learn the basics of KaboomJS. From this project, I learned how to create a game loop, add sprites, and handle user input with tracking the mouse position and collision detection.

**Core concepts used in this project are:**

- User input, mouse tracking
- 2D physics and vectors
- Collision detection
- Usage of scenes
- Game states
- Game loop
